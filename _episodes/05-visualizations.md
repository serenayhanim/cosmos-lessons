# Lesson
***

Once the enough data has been collected or imported using COSMOS, it is time to visualize the data to obtain details and information we are looking for. To start visualization:

1. `Drag and drop` the data collection to the `workspace`
2. 



> ## Tip: hidden objects
>
> Like in the shell, `ls` will hide any variables or functions starting

{: .callout}
