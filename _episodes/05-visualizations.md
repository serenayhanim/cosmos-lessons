# Lesson
***

Once enough data has been collected or imported using COSMOS, it is time to visualize the data to obtain the details and information we are looking for. To start visualization:

1. `Drag and drop` the data collection to the `workspace`
2. Once you drag and drop the data collection to the workspace, `table view` opens automatically.
![Table view](../fig/Table-view.png){:height="400px" width="750px"}

There are 10 visualization options in COSMOS. When you click the little arrow on the `Table` button (top of the right-hand side of the page), it shows the all options(`List`, `Table`, `Text`, `Word Cloud`, `Frequency`, `Network`, `Map`, `Shape File`, `Pie Chart`, `Line Chart`)

If you want to visualize same data collection using more than one option:
- Click the 3 dots button on the right-hand side of the page and choose `Duplicate`.
- When it is duplicated, you can choose one visualization options. To do that, click the `Table` button and choose one from the drop down menu.

> ## More on Visualizations
>
> Once you create more than one visualization, selecting data in one view highlights the same data in the other views. 
> 
> **For example;**
> 
> let's say we created one table view and on pie chart view. When we click on one of the pie chart slices(female one), it highlights 
> female tweets on the Table view.
