## 2) Check for Updates
Cosmos active development will receive updates. Once you install COSMOS on your computer, you do not need to reinstall COSMOS to receive new updates. Since COSMOS is in active development, we developed a feature to enable you to get the latest version of COSMOS. Before using the COSMOS each time, click on the menu button on top right of the page and click on the *'Check for updates'* option.

If there is a new version, click on the 'yes' option so you can upgrade to the latest version of the COSMOS. To use the latest version, you need to restart COSMOS application.
